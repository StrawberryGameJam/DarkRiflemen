A turn-based indie survival strategy RPG set in a Lovecraftian 1920's Russia made with GODOT. Inspired by XCOM and using [GDQuest's A* navigation amazing demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ad6Us73smNs) as a base.

# Pitch

**Synopsis:** The year is an alternate 192x in Civil War Russia. Factions fight for power while the germans impose order with an iron-fist in Ukraine and the borderlands of the fallen Empire - for the common Men life has been a unending hell. In the East, however, dark forces and apparitions start to begin and the first signs of apocalypse are shown. Elder Gods are rumored to be returning as earth begins to die.

You take control of a small group of ex-soldiers, deserters, and traitors stuck in Siberia in the middle of the war, as you uncover what appears to be a relic of times past - perhaps capable of stopping these cosmic aberrations of coming to earth. Your objective is to survive and take this relic to the time portal - no matter the cost.

**Characters:** The game should have almost no characters on-itself, since the squad you control is randomly generated and dead soldiers can be replaced, however, some notable appearances are "PUNISHED" KEIDANN, a latvian veteran, and ANASTASYA, which will accompany the player in the tutorial and story, while enemy commanders will also be mentioned, like UGERN-STERNBERG, VACIETIS, and RASPUTIN.

Also, like XCOM, every new generated soldier will have a corresponding backstory and nation/unit it fought in the Great War.

**Spoilers of the Storymode:** The relic you have found is actually time-related (and that's why it works, since the elder gods existed before time and so you could kinda trap them Dr. Strange-like), and that's why you can load and reload saves (which actually makes the soldier carrying the relic remember, losing sanity but keeping traits/levels), in the end, you have the option to end the apocalypse but keep humanity as-is - therefore keeping the destruction but ensuring the elder gods will probably not return in humanity's lifetime - or rewind back time before the war, ensuing nobody will remember the evens (and keeping the suffering of the war for later) and probably stopping apocalypse, but it is not so clarified (think of Bastion's ending).

If the cultists take the relic, then instead of the dark gods being awaken in 192x's, they will have always ruled humanity as slaves since ancient times.

**Themes:** The main, overt theme, is of war and suffering, and how you will see your soldiers experience horrors of war and decide wether they can go back before it or if they will have to live with it. HOWEVER, one other theme of the game is the meta-exploration of how you as a gamer can act as the dark gods you're fighting, since you see humanity in the game as just a simulation of people and their pain is not real or not perceviable, and therefore, your soldiers are expendable (think of Darkest Dungeon, where you dismiss soldiers after they are too spent). In fact, the gameplay should be constructed in a way that caring or not about your soldiers DOESN'T help you in any way, and if you do care about your soldiers, its a demonstration on the point of how humanity feels empathy, and if you don't, it's how the dark gods are a reflection of humanity's future.

**Gameplay:** It's a top-down, turn-based strategy game (the combat should really remind you of XCOM: EU) with a few nudges of RPG (decisions that will affect the final outcomes) and survival elements (scavenging for resources).

The goal is to survive a number of days while doing tasks until you face the final bosses. Every turn you control your soldier, which will have 2 actions (like, walking and shooting) and so does the enemy AI, in each individual map you have a few objectives and a few additional things to do. You also have to return back to your base and take care of the general map of the area.

Every soldier will have generated traits, backstory, likes and dislikes and additional quests (as noted in the themes, this doesn't buff you at all).

**Art Style:** GIVE ME THAT SWEET SWEET RUSSIAN REVOLUTION STYLE BUT NOW WITH LOVECRAFTIAN THEMES. YEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH
